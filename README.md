# Qiskit Applied Examples
A collection of practical Qiskit examples illustrating fundamental quantum computing concepts and well-known algorithms, with a focus on clear implementation, limitations, and reproducibility using local simulators.

This repository is intended as a learning-oriented project, emphasizing:
- Hands-on implementations rather than theoretical completeness
- Reproducible results using local simulators
- Clear explanations of what each example does and does *not* demonstrate
- Realistic expectations about current quantum hardware

## Scope and philosophy

Quantum computing is often presented with excessive hype.  
The goal of this repository is to explore **what quantum algorithms can actually do in practice**, starting from simple, well-understood cases.

This is **not**:
- A production-ready quantum software library
- A collection of cutting-edge research results
- A claim that quantum advantage is currently achievable

This **is**:
- A set of carefully documented examples
- A personal study project made public
- A resource for students and engineers learning Qiskit
